In this repo various techniques are used to improve over the current baseline for certification of score-based diffusion models. The models are found in Models/score_based/ and are identified by the use of "main" in the name. Currently, there are three "main" models available, "main_x.py" which uses the clean data as a target and output to the diffusion net, the "main_e.py" which uses the added noise and the "main_mnist.py" which uses the clean data as a target but it is an example of latent diffusion trained on the mnist digits dataset. The execution of each diffusion model is done using an "exec" file, including the "exec_distillation.py" which performs one step of progressive distillation, allowing to train a student model that has N//2 diffusion steps from an original teacher with N steps.
